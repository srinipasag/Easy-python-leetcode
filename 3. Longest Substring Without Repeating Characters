3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
      windowStart, maxLength = 0, 0
        hashmap = {}
        for windowEnd in range(len(s)):
            if s[windowEnd] in hashmap:
			# If the element is present in the hashmap then start considering from that position. 
			# Also make sure to take the greatest of the then windowStart value and the value present in the hashmap
                windowStart = max(windowStart ,hashmap[s[windowEnd]] + 1)
            hashmap[s[windowEnd]] = windowEnd
            maxLength = max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1)
        return maxLength
